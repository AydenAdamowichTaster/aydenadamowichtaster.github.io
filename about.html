                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p><b>Hello!</b> My name is Ayden Adamowich and this is my website. I am 13 years old and I am a big computer nerd. I work on Youtube, HTML, and Goanimate for some enterainment purposes.</b></p>
                <h2>About Channel</h2>
                <p>The Ayden Adamowich Taster was created on May 16, 2023 and this is the only videos that I had ever talk. But these videos didn't last long so they were deleted. But on June 21, 2023 we had publish our first video to stay ever on our channel called "<b>Ramune Grape</b>" and also the other videos for infinity and beyond. Then on August 4, 2023 we had publish our first unboxing video called "<b>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</b>". But then on October 9, 2023 we had reached our first milestone by reaching 300 subscribers on Youtube but immediately slowed down by November. Then on December 26, 2023 we made a new unboxing video called "<b>Minecraft: Dungeons</b>". But on Feburary 19, 2024 we had almost accidentally deleted our channel but God save the day and my channel is still here. But sadly on April 30, 2024 the unboxing era has officially ended for the good of my channel. On May 17, 2024 <b>The Ayden Adamowich Taster: Season 2</b> has came to Youtube! And that is all I have to say for now.</p>
                <h2>About Website</h2>
                <p>On Janurary 24, 2024 we had bombed our old website because It was not getting views at all. So what will we do now? Make it into something cooler. So our new website has all the old features from last time. But this time we had made it way cooler. By add a wood background and adding colorful text to make it so cool and stuff.
